with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

filename = input("Enter the filename: ")
try:
    with open(filename) as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    new_content = content.upper()
    
    with open("new_" + filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(new_content)
        print("Created new_" + filename)
